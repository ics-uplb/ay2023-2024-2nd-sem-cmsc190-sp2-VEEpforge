Authors: Ezra Earl P. Villanueva and Mylah Rystie U. Anacleto

The *caves* isolation source web application was developed to provide a database for the microbial data and metadata collected from caves in CALABARZON. It implemented features like Microbial Isolation Source Ontology (MISO) tags, interactive maps, and search and filtering tools to provide systematic access to strain isolation sources and environmental information. The application received an excellent System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 82.1875 from 8 respondents, indicating acceptable usability.
